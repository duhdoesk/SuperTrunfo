        Hi!\n
        I\'m Eduardo Scaranari, the developer of this app.\n\n
        As a huge fan of the Grow\'s Super Trunfo Battle Cards and also an Android student, I just
        decided to code it for practice.\n\n
        Hope you enjoy it and, if you do, don\'t hesitate on contacting me using one of the channels below.
